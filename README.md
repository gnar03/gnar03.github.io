# gnar03.github.io

My custom startpage.

I didn't make this since I don't know anythinb about code. I just combined 2 existing startpages, tried to understand part of the code through some googling and edited them to my liking.

The 2 startpages I used came from https://startpages.github.io/ and are the following:
Homepage By seanvree & haltdev: https://seanvree.github.io/homepage/ - https://github.com/seanvree/homepage
Start By allgenesconsidered: https://startpages.github.io/startpages/start-allgenesconsidered/ - https://github.com/allgenesconsidered/START

The looks I based on dark mode of default new tab of Firefox.

Use https://gnar03.github.io/ as startpage.

Feel free to use and edit to your liking.
