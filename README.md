# gnar03.github.io

My custom startpage.

I didn't make this since I don't know anything about code. I just combined 2 existing startpages, tried to understand part of the code through some googling and edited them to my liking. So there might be some redundant files and code in it that have no use.

The 2 startpages I used came from https://startpages.github.io/ and are the following:
* Homepage By seanvree & haltdev: https://seanvree.github.io/homepage/ - https://github.com/seanvree/homepage
* Start By allgenesconsidered: https://startpages.github.io/startpages/start-allgenesconsidered/ - https://github.com/allgenesconsidered/START

The looks I based on dark mode of default new tab on Firefox.

Use https://gnar03.github.io/ as startpage.

To place the cursor in the search bar of the page, use the extension Custom New Tabs: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tabs/ (github: https://github.com/deadmund/Custom-New-Tab/wiki)

Feel free to use and edit to your liking.
